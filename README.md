# Hungry Zone Restaurant Ordering System

A simple restaurant ordering system built using shell scripting. This project allows users to select food items, sizes, and quantities from a menu, and calculates the total bill based on their choices. The script mimics a real-world restaurant order process.

## Features

- Interactive menu with five food categories:
  - Pizza
  - Hot Dog
  - Sandwich
  - Burger
  - Drinks
- Choose different sizes and quantities for each item
- Calculates total bill based on the user's order
- Option to place multiple orders in one session

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ibrahim-patwary/operating-system-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd operating-system-project
    ```

3. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x restaurants.sh
    ```

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./restaurants.sh
    ```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to place your order.
